<p>Theoneste was appointed Deputy Managing Director for SDS.ltd since August 2012 with responsibility also as the co-founder together with Dr. Gabriel.</p>
<p> I have been in labor market since 1999 when I graduated from secondary school but I interrupted working periods with studies on many occasions. 
	I worked for different public and private institutions before the establishment of SDS.ltd. 
	
	<ol>
		<li>I worked at National University of Rwanda (NUR) as a research assistant and laboratory technician for nearly two year since 2007. 
		<li>At the Ministry of infrastructure I was in charge of monitoring the stability of Lake Kivu throughout extraction process of methane gas from 2008-2009. 
		<li>I worked as a volunteer in different local NGOs like Association pour la Conservation de la Nature au Rwanda (ACNR), Association Rwandaise des Ecologistes (ARECO-RWANDA NZIZA) and Association pour la Promotion des Etudes dâ€™Impact Environnementaux Au Rwanda (APEIER). 
		<li>I am giving some training of EIA to local professionals and partially teaching Environmental courses in a local University.  
	</ol>
<p>I am holding a BSc. in Biology especially Zoology from National University of Rwanda since 2007 and a Master of Engineering in Oil and Gas Field Development from China University of Geosciences since 2011. </p>  
<p>I am motivated by my versatile skills in science and Engineering. One may be astonished by how I have been moved by the engineering wind to oil and gas sector but am feeling so comfortable in both area; reconciling environmental protection and natural resource exploitation.</p>   
<p>Innovation, self motivation, team spirit and time respect these are strengths at the service delivery.</p>
